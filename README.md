# castnow

castnow is a command-line utility that can be used to play back media files on
your Chromecast device. It supports playback of local video files, YouTube
clips, videos on the web and torrents. You can also re-attach a running
playback session \(this sentence should belong somewhere else).

### interested in being a castnow maintainer?

I currently don't have that much time to maintain this project and have also lost some interest (to be honest).
Main reason is that we have had a new TV for a few months that supports casting directly to it using
DLNA \(you may wanna checkout [dlnacast](https://github.com/xat/dlnacast)).
Feel free to contact me \( [simon@sope.io](simon@sope.io) ) if you want to be added as a maintainer to castnow.

### usage

```

// start playback of a local video file
castnow ./myvideo.mp4

// start playback of video and mp3 files in the local directory
castnow ./mydirectory/

// playback 3 videos after each other
castnow video1.mp4 video2.mp4 video3.mp4

// start playback of an mp4 file over the web
castnow http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/ED_1280.mp4

// start playback of a youtube clip
castnow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcVRrlmpcWk

// start playback of a video over torrent
castnow <url-to-torrent-file OR magnet>

// start playback of a video over torrent with local subtitles
castnow <url-to-torrent-file OR magnet> --subtitles </local/path/to/subtitles.srt>

// transcode some other video format to mp4 while playback (requires ffmpeg)
castnow ./myvideo.avi --tomp4

// re-attach to a currently running playback session
castnow

```

### options

* `--tomp4` Transcode a video file to mp4 during playback. This option requires
ffmpeg to be installed on your computer. The play / pause controls are currently
not supported in transcode mode.

* `--device "my chromecast"` If you have more than one Chromecast on your network,
use the `--device` option to specify the device on which you want to start casting.
Otherwise, castnow will just use the first device it finds in the network.

* `--address 192.168.1.4` The IP address or hostname of your chromecast. This will skip
the MDNS scan.

* `--subtitles <path/URL>` This can be a path or URL to a vtt or srt file that
contains subtitles.

* `--myip 192.168.1.8` Your main IP address \(useful if you have multiple network adapters)

* `--quiet` Hide the player timeline.

* `--peerflix-<option> <argument>` Pass options to peerflix.

* `--ffmpeg-<option> <argument>` Pass options to ffmpeg.

* `--type <type>` Explicity set the mime-type of the first item in the playlist (e.g. 'video/mp4').

* `--seek <hh:mm:ss>` Seek to the specified time on start using the format hh:mm:ss or mm:ss.

* `--bypass-srt-encoding` Disable automatic UTF-8 encoding of SRT subtitles.

* `--loop` Play the list of files over and over in a loop, forever.

* `--help` Display help message.

### player controls

```

space   // toggle between play and pause
m       // toggle mute
up      // volume up
down    // volume down

q       // quit

```
